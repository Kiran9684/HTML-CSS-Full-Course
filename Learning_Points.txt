	1.pseudo class in css - it basically adds extra styles in certain situations, for ex when we hover over a html element. 
	ex1- ':hover' is a pseudo class which can be used to add extra style when we hover over a element. 
	ex2- ':active' is a pseudo class which can be used to add extra style when we click on the element. 

	2.Transitions
	It's basically to change the styling effects smoothly.(for ex when we add extra styles using pseudo classes).
	css property -> 'transition' 
	it takes 2 values 1-> what to transit(property name) 2-> How smoothly you want the transition to happen/How long this transition will take(in seconds/milliseconds).

	It's always preferred to use transition property in the base Css style, so that if there are any extra styling that is used using pseudo classes then the changes transition will happen
	smoothly as per values defined in transition property.

	<Important!!>
	CSS Specificity : If we have multiple lines setting the same property there is actually a priority that follows. 
		[The selector that is more specific has higher priority].
		class name selector has more priority > than element name selector.
